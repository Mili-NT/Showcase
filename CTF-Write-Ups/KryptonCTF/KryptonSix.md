# Level: KryptonSix
## Level Credentials: krypton6:RANDOM
## Level Description: *n this example, the keyfile is in your directory, however it is not readable by you. The binary ‘encrypt6’ is also available. It will read the keyfile and encrypt any message you desire, using the key AND a ‘random’ number. You get to perform a ‘known ciphertext’ attack by introducing plaintext of your choice. The challenge here is not simple, but the ‘random’ number generator is weak.*
