## Level Description: *There is nothing on this page.*

### Steps: 
I initally was focused on the submit token button, but there was nothing there that could help me.    
When I was inspecting the body html, there was a one pixel image in the box.    
### Solution
The image was stored in a directory called /files/, which was luckily an open directory.    
Inside that same directory is a *users.txt* file that contains the flag.
