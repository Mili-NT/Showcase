# Challenge: Password Strength
## Challenge Description: *Log in with the administrator's user credentials without previously changing them or applying SQL Injection.*

### Steps: 
I solved this doing preliminary checks for the login admin challenge. Using a script to brute force common variations of admin and admin*, the administrator was using a weak password of admin123

### Solution:
Check for weak, reused, or default credentials as a path of least resistance to privilege escalation.
