# Challenge: Confidential Document
## Challenge Description: *Access a confidential document.*

### Steps: 
I actually solved this unintentionally while looking for scoreboard. I was running OWASP:ZAP and grepping through the output.
The document opened was `aquisitions.md` in the `ftp directory`.
### Solution:
Run a spidering tool or similar, and open the sensitive `aquistions.md` to ccomplete the challenge.
